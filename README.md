# Edict-of-Ruin
A game I am making. Mechanics are based on / inspired by Baten Kaitos, a Gamecube series from 2003 and 2008.

Edict of Ruin is a turn-based strategy game that uses a dungeon-crawling choose-your-adventure style of storytelling, and game mechanics based on Baten Kaitos EWaTLO, the original.

Game Mechanics
-------------------------
Players will begin the game with a set character, giving them a name, and will progress the game by defeating enemies, growing stronger and completing the storyline. 
Players can grow stronger by defeating enemies and completing quests and can allot new points into their stats after gaining levels. Players will also gain access to stronger items to fight with as they progress.

Players have a Health Points (HP) Bar, if your points/bar reaches 0, you lose the game, use consumables or other methods to heal your points. Enemies also have an HP Bar and will die when their points/bar reaches 0 granting you EXP, consumables (including key consumables), and battle cards.

Battle is turn based, and depends on how fast you can make your decisions as well as strategizing how to fight certain enemies.
Use your Hand to see which cards you have randomly drawn from your Deck.
-- more updates on ( rank order, chaining, the nextaction list, log, and Enemy / Player Effects and Buffs ) later.

EXP -- will be updayed, monsters can drop EXP, quests can grant EXP
Money -- will be updated, monsters will drop ranges of money, can use to buy items at certain areas.

Decision making for the story, I will try to make a diverse storyline that gie replay value.

I only plan to work on this "intensely" for about a month. This is more of a learning project, while experimenting with how much functionality I can achieve with pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I do not have a current plan for a database, so progress and accounts will not be kept
Currently I have an HTML page and CSS styling done for "battle" pages. I will also have to learn to generalize this through Javascript.
I am also starting to make the "Deck" and "items" Javscript file, I will be breaking up the Deck generally into battle cards and consumables, while items may hold some features of both or perhaps be a file for special "key" consumables. After I make some base data I can work with, as in a variety of cards both of consumables and battle cards, I will try to make some "cards" for the enemy and then try to make the "cards" affect the player and enemy HP. I also will be adding some "shake" effect to the enemy to simulate damage taken.

Action List, Log, Effects / Buffs, and the random drawing of cards for each side will be done later.
